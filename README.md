- Rosetta.MDExtractor-script-plugins
- updated to v1.1
- original v1.0 versions now part of v1.0 release
- if you have ExifTool or MediaInfo plugin v1.0 in your system, you will need to edit/raise the plugin version value in <pl:version> element in 'metadata_ExifToolMDExtractorPlugin.xml' or 'metadata_MediaInfoMDExtractorPlugin.xml' file in \PLUGIN-INF\ inside the plugin, so the plugin is actually deployed over the old version
